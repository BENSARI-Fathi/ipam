# IP Address Management (IPAM) System with Go

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an IP Address Management (IPAM) system built using Go. The project aims to provide a centralized solution for efficiently managing IP address allocation, assignment, and tracking within a network infrastructure. The IPAM system facilitates the automation of IP address management tasks, simplifying network administration and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## Key Features
- **IP Address Allocation:** Dynamically allocates IP addresses from predefined IP address pools based on specified criteria.
- **IP Address Assignment:** Assigns IP addresses to devices, hosts, or services within the network infrastructure.
- **Subnet Management:** Manages IP address subnets and subnet masks to organize and segment the network.
- **IP Address Tracking:** Tracks the usage and status of allocated IP addresses, including availability and utilization statistics.
- **Customizable Policies:** Supports customizable policies for IP address allocation, assignment, and release based on user-defined rules.
- **Network Discovery:** Provides network discovery capabilities to identify active devices and services within the network.
- **RESTful API:** Exposes a RESTful API for programmatic interaction with the IPAM system, enabling integration with other network management tools and systems.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to IPAM functionalities and data.

## Technologies Used
- **Go:** A statically typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency support.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL:** Utilizes SQLite or PostgreSQL as the backend database for storing IP address allocation and management data.
- **RESTful API:** Implements a RESTful API using standard Go HTTP server libraries or frameworks like Gorilla Mux.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Utilizes JWT for secure authentication and authorization of API requests.
- **Docker:** Provides Dockerization for easy deployment and scalability of the IPAM system.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Generates API documentation for easy reference and integration with other systems.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the database settings in the project configuration file (`config.yml` or similar).
3. Build the Go application using the provided build instructions.
4. Run the application and access the IPAM system through the provided endpoints.
5. Integrate the IPAM system with existing network management tools or systems using the RESTful API.
